Using the APi from this website: https://animechan.vercel.app/

Look at the solution.js file. Write a request to the given API and return an object with the anime key and the name of the anime, and the name of the person who said the quote as a key and the quote as that key's value.

The result should look something like this:

{anime: 'Naruto', 'Rock Lee': 'If you believe in your dreams, I will prove to you, that you can achieve your dreams just by working hard.'}
